## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used nested Flexbox elements to achieve this layout. The body element is the first flexbox element with a `flex-direction` of `column`, and `align-items: center` is used to center the content in the viewport. The `<ul>` containing the user stats is also a flexbox element, but with `flex-direction: row` and `justify-content: space-evenly` used to space the statistics out horizontally. 

### Continued development

I was not able to display the background images properly on my own. After looking over some solutions from the Frontend Mentor community, I was able to reach a solution. I need more practice with background image placement, especially with multiple background images. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This resource explains how to use and position multiple background images with CSS. 

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This site gives a great overview of the basics of Flexbox and provides several code examples.
